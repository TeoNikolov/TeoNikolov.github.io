## About
The WASP Summer School Synthesis of Human Communication 2022 was a networking event organized by [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program](https://wasp-sweden.org/). It took place in Norrköping, Sweden, between 22-Aug-2022 and 26-Aug-2022.

Speakers from industrial and academic backgrounds were invited to present their work to attendees, while PhD students were tasked with completing an assignment on the topic of generative AI, to earn credits towards their degrees.

The summer school was rounded off in the [Norrköping Visualisation Center](https://visualiseringscenter.se/en) 3D dome, in which [3D video demos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIg3Fnk71bdlRUuCPCKDBTjjNYu17zQWu&si=fHoMHeYTrxekqFzV) showcasing the students' submissions were presented.

## Responsibilities
Teaching & Organization:
- Write a technical [gesture generation tutorial](https://github.com/TeoNikolov/wasp-2022-summer-school/tree/main/subsystem3_gesture-generation) with student exercises.
- Mentor students during the completion of the gesture generation tutorial.
- Organize and coordinate the collection of assignment submissions.

- Train a **Python** [AI model](https://github.com/teonikolov/Speech_driven_gesture_generation_with_autoencoder/tree/GENEA_2022) on a [gesture dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/6998231) to generate **BVH** gesture animations for speaking avatars. Multiple models were trained with different hyperparameters, deployed using **Docker** on a remote **Linux** machine.
- Produce [4 cinematics](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIg3Fnk71bdlRUuCPCKDBTjjNYu17zQWu&si=fHoMHeYTrxekqFzV) in **Unreal Engine 4.27** from **FBX** data, in collaboration with [Mihail Tsakov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mihailtsakov/).
- Build an **nDisplay** project (UE4.27) and test it in the [Norrköping Visualisation Center](https://visualiseringscenter.se/en) 3D dome.
