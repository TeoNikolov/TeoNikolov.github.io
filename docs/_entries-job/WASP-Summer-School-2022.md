### About
The WASP Summer School Synthesis of Human Communication 2022 is a networking event organized by [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program](https://wasp-sweden.org/). It took place in Norrköping, Sweden, between 22-Aug-2022 and 26-Aug-2022.

Speakers from industrial and academic backgrounds were invited to present their work to attendees, while PhD students were tasked with completing an assignment on the topic of generative AI, to earn credits towards their degrees. At the end of the summer school, [video demos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIg3Fnk71bdlRUuCPCKDBTjjNYu17zQWu&si=fHoMHeYTrxekqFzV) showcasing the students' submissions were presented in the [Norrköping Visualisation Center](https://visualiseringscenter.se/en).
